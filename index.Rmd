# Preface {-}

```{r echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pack-your-code-logo.png")
```

This book aims to teach you how to create a relatively simple R package based on the so-called S3 classes.

I assume that you are already familiar with R, RStudio. You don't need to be an expert useR but you do need to feel comfortable working with various data structures: vectors, factors, arrays, matrices, lists, data frames, etc.

You also need to be familiar with programming structures: how to create simple functions, conditional `if-then-else()`, `for()` loops, `while()` loops, `repeat` loops.


You will create various functions:

- define a function to create a `"coin"` object.

- write a function to `toss()` the coin and produce an object of class `"toss"`.

- write common methods such as `print()`, `summary()`, and `plot()`.

- write companion functions `is.toss()`, `as.toss()`

- implement S3 methods for extraction `[.toss`, replacement `[<-.toss`, addition `+.toss`


You will write unit tests for your functions


You will package your code, and learn an opinionated workflow to build packages:

- generate documentation
- check manual documentation
- run tests
- build vignettes
- build tarball
- install your package
- share it via github
