# Filestructure {#structure}

## Introduction

In this chapter we'll describe the anatomy of a package: the types of files and their organization into various directories.


## Scenarios

The following diagram depicts three possible filestructures for a package.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Three possible filestructures for a package'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-structures.png")
```

The first option is what we usually consider to be a __minimal__ package involving four components: `DESCRIPTION` file, `NAMESPACE` file, `R/` directory, and `man/` directory.

The second option corresponds to the __default structure__ generated by RStudio (via the package `"devtools"`) when you use an RStudio project. This is why you see the `.Rproj` file.

The third option is the actual structure for our __working example__. Starting with a default structure, we can add more elements like a `README.md` files, and directories for `tests/` and `vignettes/`. The extra directory `inst/` is generated in the building process.
