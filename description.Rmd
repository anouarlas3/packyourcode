# Description File {#description}

## Introduction

Every package needs a `DESCRIPTION` file.


## Minimal Description

When creating an "off-the-shelf" package, like the _hello world_ example, the file `DESCRIPTION` will contain some default lines:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Typical default content in a DESCRIPTION file'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-description.png")
```

After customizing the content of `DESCRIPTION`, you could end up with something like this:

```
Package: cointoss
Type: Package
Title: Simulates tossing a coin
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Gaston Sanchez
Maintainer: Gaston Sanchez <gaston@email.com>
Description: Functions to create a coin object, to toss a coin multiple times,
    and to summarize and visualize frequencies of the tosses.
License: GPL-2
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```


### Author and Maintainer

You need to provide the name(s) of the author(s). You also need to designate one (and only one) person who will be in charge of maintaining the package. The role of the maintainer is essentially fixing bugs, and integrate new code and build a new version.


### License

- Your package needs a license.
- You should choose a license intended for software.
- Software licenses generally refer to source code.
- The explicit reference to source code recognizes the fact that software code can exist in its source form, in addition to its binary form.

What licenses are available? There is a list of suggested licenses in the R-project website: [https://www.r-project.org/Licenses](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/).

- `MIT`: MIT license
- `GPL-2` or `GPL-3`: GNU General Public License (GPL)
- `Artistic-2.0`: Artistic License version 2.0
- `apache-2` Apache License 2.0
- `BSD_3_clause`: BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" license
- `BSD_2_clause`: BSD 2-Clause "Simplified" or "FreeBSD" license
- `LGPL-2`: GNU Library or "Lesser" General Public License (LGPL)

You can find more user friendly information about these and other popular licenses in the website of the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses). Likewise, you can also check the "Choose a license" guidelines available at https://choosealicense.com/licenses/.

Although R-project suggests the "Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike International License" version 4.0, I discourage the use of any Creative Commons (CC) license for software. CC licenses are good for __media__ content (ne.g. arrative, images, music), but not for source code.
