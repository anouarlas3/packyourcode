# Description File {#description}

## Introduction

Every package needs a `DESCRIPTION` file.


## Minimal Description

When creating an "off-the-shelf" package, like the _hello world_ example, the file `DESCRIPTION` will contain some default lines:

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.cap = 'Default content in DESCRIPTION'}
knitr::include_graphics("images/pkg-description.png")
```

After customizing the content of `DESCRIPTION`, you could end up with something like this:

```
Package: cointoss

    and to summarize and visualize frequencies of the tosses.

```
